   Bot provides list of differnt analysis it can do [S2]
   Reviewer provides go-ahead for the analysis he/she wants [S3]
   Bot runs analysis, and posts stats as a comment [S4]

  [S3] User will confirm which analysis to run. Eg. @crabot Run Service1, Service2
  [S4] Bot will run requested analysis, and post stats on the GitHub comment thread.

4 Alternative Flows
  [E1] User can choose to run all the services offered by crabot by saying @crabot Run all.
  [E2] User can choose not to run any analysis.

--------------------------------------------------

Use Case: Get Code-review-stats automatically for new pull-requests (medium-sized) 
1 Preconditions
   Repo owner must have added bot as a collaborator.
   We will define medium-size code by an arbitrary SLOC range.

2 Main Flow
   User will submit a PR to repo [S1]
   Bot detects size of PR to be medium, runs analysis automatically and posts stats as a comment [S2]

3 Subflows
  [S1] User submits PR to repo.
  [S2] Bot will get auto-invoked from web hook, will run analysis, and post stats on the GitHub comment thread.

4 Alternative Flows
  [E1] User can again comment on the thread requesting crabot to run all or some of the services. Eg. @crabot Run Service1, Service2

--------------------------------------------------  

Use Case: Get Code-review-stats for new pull-requests (small-sized) 
1 Preconditions
   Repo owner must have added bot as a collaborator.
   We will define small-size code by an arbitrary SLOC range.

2 Main Flow
   User will submit a PR to repo [S1]
   Bot detects size of PR to be small, and so ignores it [S2]
   User can manually invoke the bot to run specific analysis [S3]
   Bot runs analysis, and posts stats as a comment [S4]

3 Subflows
  [S1] User submits PR to repo.
  [S2] Bot will get auto-invoked from web hook, detects small code size, and will suggest to run all the sevices 
  [S3] User will request all the services to run. Eg. @crabot Run all.
  [S4] Bot will run requested analysis, and post stats on the GitHub comment thread.

4 Alternative Flows
  [E1] User can choose which analysis to run. Eg. @crabot Run Service1, Service2
  [E2] User can choose not to run any analysis.
